### Disclaimer

The official Python Faster R-CNN code is available [here](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).

This is only an adaptation of the original code mentioned before to be able to run in a ODROID XU4 along with a ROS node with only its CPU. Files added in this version are: /tools/demoClayROSImage.py and /tools/demoClayROSVideo.py. Both of this nodes are subscribed to the topic /camera/image_raw which were tested with a robot NAO.

The instructions for installing this code are the same than the original code.
